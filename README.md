#NOTES:
This project converts images to a .ico format in different sizes, along with generating the corresponding HTML <link tag codes manifest for a website's head

The output is a zip file with the converted images of various sizes + html

This project supports the following file formats: 
{".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".bmp", ".gif", ".tiff", ".webp"}

#Before running the above code locally, make sure to:

#1 pip install python

#2 Install Pillow using "pip install pillow" on your terminal

#3 Run the main.py script

#4 On your terminal pass in the one of the suggested image files available: "(sample1.jpg, sample2.png, sample3.webp, sample4.gif, sample5.bmp, sample6.tiff, sample7.jpeg)" or FILEPATH: ") or give a file path that contains the image you want to convert must be a supported image

5# You will see the converted files and zip files in the same directory

#NEXT COMMIT WILL BE INTEGRATING THIS PYTHON SCRIPT INTO DJANGO ENVIRONMENT
